# 🔢 Learning NumPy – A Hands-on Journey

Welcome to my **NumPy learning repository**, where I document everything I’m mastering about NumPy — from the absolute basics to practical hands-on exercises.

Whether you're just starting or brushing up your skills, this repo will guide you through **every core NumPy concept** using organized Python scripts and notes.

## 📘 What’s Inside?

Each script focuses on a specific concept and is full of **clear examples and in-code comments**.

### 🧱 Core Scripts:
- `Creating Arrays.py`: All ways to create arrays — manual, `zeros`, `ones`, `arange`, `linspace`, etc.
- `Array attributes.py`: Learn `.shape`, `.ndim`, `.dtype`, `.size`, etc.
- `Array functions.py`: Useful built-in functions like `sum`, `mean`, `argmax`, etc.
- `Range and sequences.py`: Sequences using `arange`, `linspace`, and range-like behavior in NumPy.
- `Random arrays.py`: Random number generation and working with `np.random`.
- `indexing slicing.py`: Standard indexing, slicing, negative indexing.
- `fancy indexing.py`: Boolean and fancy indexing examples.
- `rounding.py`, `splitting.py`: Utility functions for data manipulation.

### 🗂️ Topic-wise Folders:
- `Array operations/`: Arithmetic, comparison, logical operations
- `Copying of Array/`: Deep copy vs shallow copy concepts
- `Reshaping Arrays/`: Reshape, flatten, ravel, transpose
- `Stacking/`: Vertical and horizontal stacking, concatenation
